# chess_engine

This is a python based chess engine with an integrated GUI which works by making use of simple machine learning concepts. 

### How to use it?

Execute the python script chess_engine.py and then open 'http://localhost:5000' in your browser. You can then choose either of the 2 following modes,
1. Training mode    :   As mentioned earlier, this mode trains the chess engine. The training data can be found in 'data' folder. You can add chess games that you like in the folder as well (make sure that they're in .pgn format). You can also edit the chess_engine.py file to alter the variables like number of learning iterations, learning rate, board features etc.

2. Testing mode :   You can play a game of chess against the chess engine in this mode. Theme of the chess pieces and style of board can be changed from the files testing_page.html and index.js.
