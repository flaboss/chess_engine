1. d4 { Notes by Bruce Leverett: I was amused at the start of
the game when my opponent placed a little rubber toy elephant
on the table next to her scoresheet. Polgar was about 10 years
old at the time. A few tables away, her sister Zsofia was
walloping E. Winslow.} Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 4. cxb5 a6 5. e3

11. Bxb3 Na6 12. Nf3 Nb4 { The game that really put White's
line out of business was Gurevich-Benjamin, Chicago Midwest
Masters 1986. I knew that game but I had an ``improvement.''
Never mind what my improvement was because, since then, I
realized that it was bogus. If Polgar had wanted to see for
herself, she could have followed that game with 12 ... exd5,
but instead she makes it a gambit. Possibly unsound, but as we
shall see, it was good enough to beat me. } 13. dxe6 fxe6
